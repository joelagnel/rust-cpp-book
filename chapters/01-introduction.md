## Introduction

If you are a C or C++ programmer looking to explore Rust, you might find some of its
concepts both familiar and distinctively novel. Rust emphasizes safety,
explicitness, and modern programming paradigms, often in ways that differ
significantly from C or C++. Here, we'll walk through key concepts with examples to
help one make the transition. Note that there are many excellent articles in this
spirit, however this is my own that I wrote during my journey, which helps someone
like me (a kernel or low-level systems programmer). It is expected that the reader
is already familiar with some basic rust syntax.
