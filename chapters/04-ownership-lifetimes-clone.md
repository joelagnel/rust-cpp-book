## Ownership, Lifetimes and Cloning
When passing objects to functions, Rustï¿½s ownership model ensures that ownership must be explicitly managed. For types that **do not** implement the `Copy` trait, you need to either pass a reference or explicitly clone the object.

### Example:  Passing Vectors implies move semantic as Vector doesn't have Copy trait

```rust
fn print_vector(v: Vec<i32>) {
    println!("{:?}", v);
}

let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
print_vector(v); // Ownership is moved
// println!("{:?}", v); // Compile-time error: `v` no longer accessible

let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
print_vector(v.clone()); // Clone explicitly
println!("{:?}", v); // `v` is still accessible
```

#### Comparison with other languages

C++ to its credit also has move semantics, but the std::move has to be specified otherwise the entire vector is copied. This is obviously less efficient. Rust with its focus on efficiency assumes std::move as the right thing to do.

```cpp
std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
printVector(std::move(v)); // Ownership moved
// v is now in an unspecified state.
```

But Java is worse, mutable vectors are passed implicitly which though efficient is prone to ownership issues

```java
List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);
modifyList(list);
// `list` is still accessible after the function and potentially modified.
```

Note that an array in Rust (as opposed to a Vector) does result in an implicit Copy, much like C++, when passing arrays to functions. This is because elements in an Array are typically allocated in the stack and arrays are fixed size whose size is available at compile time. The compiler then decides to do a full copy when copying these. This happens only if the array's elements have a type with the `Copy` trait, such as `i32`. It is possible to avoid this by passing references to the array if a copy is not desired.

### Another example: Mutable references also don't have Copy trait

There can only be one mutable reference (AKA mutable borrow) on an object at a time. So naturally, assigning one mutable reference to another should invalidate the first one. This is exactly why a mutable reference does not have the `Copy` trait and implies move semantics, I believe this only moves the "pointer" to a new "pointer". The data being moved in this case is the pointer.

For example, the following code will not compile due to the same reason as above.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 42;
    let ptr2 = &mut x;  // create mutable ref
    let y = ptr2;       // mutable ref moved

    println!("{} {}", y, ptr2);
}
```

Results in the following error:
```rust
error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `ptr2`
 --> src/main.rs:4:26
  |
2 |     let mut x = 42; let ptr2 = &mut x; let y = ptr2;
  |                         ----                   ---- value moved here
  |                         |
  |                         move occurs because `ptr2` has type `&mut i32`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
3 |
4 |     println!("{} {}", y, ptr2);
  |                          ^^^^ value borrowed here after move
```

On the other hand, immutable references do have the `Copy` trait! This is because it is safe to have multiple immutable references to the same data.

### Mutable borrows lock out copying

In rust, mutable borrows lock out copying. This is because mutable borrows are exclusive, meaning that once a mutable reference is created, the original value cannot be accessed or copied until the mutable reference goes out of scope. This ensures that the mutable reference is the only way to access the value, preventing data races and ensuring memory safety.

Consider the following example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 42;     // x is an i32 which has Copy trait
    x += 1;
    let ptr2 = &mut x;  // mutable borrow means..
    let y = x;          // ..x is inaccessible event for copying

    println!("{} {} {}", x, y, ptr2);
}
```

This results in the following error:
```rust
error[E0503]: cannot use `x` because it was mutably borrowed
 --> src/main.rs:5:13
  |
4 |     let ptr2 = &mut x;  // create mutable ref
  |                ------ `x` is borrowed here
5 |     let y = x;       // mutable ref moved
  |             ^ use of borrowed `x`
6 |
7 |     println!("{} {} {}", x, y, ptr2);
  |                                ---- borrow later used here
```

If ptr2 is not a mutable reference, then the code would compile fine.

Note that this only applies to references, a mutable variable on its own
can be copied while it is still in scope.

For example, the following code compiles fine:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 42;
    let y = x;
    println!("{} {}", x, y);
}
```
### Cloning vs Copying

In Rust, `clone` and `copy` are distinct mechanisms for duplicating values:

1. **Copy Trait**:
   - For simple, stack-allocated types (e.g., integers, floats, `bool`), `Copy` provides implicit, cheap duplication by copying memory.
   - Example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = 42;
    let b = a; // `a` is still valid
    println!("a: {}, b: {}", a, b);
}
```

2. **Clone Trait**:
   - For complex types like `String` or `Vec`, `Clone` requires an explicit `.clone()` call and allows custom duplication logic.
   - Example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone();
    println!("s1: {}, s2: {}", s1, s2);
}
```

| **Aspect**   | **Copy**                  | **Clone**                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Behavior** | Implicit, cheap           | Explicit, customizable           |
| **Use Case** | Simple, lightweight types | Complex, resource-managing types |

#### When to Use which

- Use `Copy` for small, fixed-size types like numbers.
- Use `Clone` for heap-allocated or resource-heavy types when deep copies are needed.

To summarize, the following table shows which types have the `Copy` trait:

| Type       | Copy Trait | Comment |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------- |
| `i32`      | Yes        |         |
| `mut i32`  | Yes        |         |
| `&i32`     | Yes        |         |
| `&mut i32` | No         | Also locks out access to original variable |
| `[i32; 3]` | Yes        | Array has trait of type of its elements |
| `Vec<i32>` | No         | Because its heap allocated and not fixed size |
| `String`   | No         | Because its heap allocated and not fixed size |

### Lifetime annotations with a practical example

Rust's lifetime annotations provide a way to explicitly indicate how references relate to each other in terms of their lifetimes, ensuring safe memory access. This avoids dangling references.

Consider the following practical example:

```rust
struct Account(String);
struct Order<'a> {
    lock: &'a Account,
    // Presumably other fields too
}

fn order_example<'a>() -> Order<'a> {
    let tris = Account("tris".into());
    Order { lock: &tris }
}
```

#### Explanation of the issue

`Order<'a>` indicates that the Order struct has a reference to an Account with the same lifetime `'a`, ensuring that the Account outlives the Order struct to prevent dangling references. In the function `order_example<'a>`, which returns an `Order<'a>`, the reference `&tris` in `Order { lock: &tris }` becomes invalid because tris is dropped at the end of the function scope. Rust enforces this by throwing a compile-time error: cannot return reference to local variable. Lifetimes are crucial because they help the Rust compiler guarantee that references do not outlive the data they point to. In this case, returning a reference to a local variable like tris is unsafe because it gets deallocated when the function exits.

#### Fixing the Example:

To fix this issue, the `Account` object must have a longer lifetime, such as being allocated on the heap or being part of a higher scope:

```rust
fn order_example<'a>(account: &'a Account) -> Order<'a> {
    Order { lock: account }
}

fn main() {
    let account = Account("tris".into());
    let order = order_example(&account);
    // Now both `account` and `order` have compatible lifetimes.
}
```

This adjustment ensures that the `account` outlives the `order`, adhering to Rust's strict ownership and borrowing rules.
